Approach / Architectire I have used 

- I have considered it as a Multi Step form.
- Created a common State and decide to load Specific component based on Step count
- Created single handler to handle state change
- Folder Structure is like

      - app

          - components folder

          - Util folder

                - constants

                - modals/interfaces/types

                - Helper functions 

- ES6+ concepts Used

          - Arrow functions

          - Object Destructuring

- Tried to use Typescript as much as possible
- Used multiple React Concepts in this project 

          - UseEffect Hook

          - UseState Hook

          - Props parent to child communication

          - Props child to Parent calling

          - Basic forms and change handling

          - Conditional Rendering of components

          - React Fragmenrs
 
 - Rest I will Demo and Explain it to you :)
