Approach / Architectire I have used 

- I have considered it as a Multi Step form.
- Created a common State and decide to load Specific component based on Step count
- Created single handler to handle state change
- Used multiple React Concepts in this project 
          - UseEffect Hook
          - UseState Hook
          - Props parent to child communication
          - Props child to Parent calling
          - Basic forms and change handling
          - Conditional Rendering of components
 
 - Rest I will Demo and Explain it to you :)
